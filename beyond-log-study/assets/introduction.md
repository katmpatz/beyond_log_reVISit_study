**Study name:** Visualization Design for Large Numbers  
**Study duration:** Approximately 35 minutes  

**Study description:**  
This study evaluates the effectiveness of several data visualization designs in representing values that span over multiple orders of magnitude (e.g., from hundreds to billions).  
These values are integral to various domains of daily life, including but not limited to financial analysis, pandemic tracking, demographic studies, environmental monitoring, and social media metrics.  
The outcomes of this study are expected to enhance our understanding of how humans process large numbers.
